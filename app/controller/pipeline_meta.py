"""
Pipeline taxonomy / phase metadata.

Single source of truth that classifies a raw ``pipeline_type`` string (as stored
on :class:`IaCJob`) into a higher-level *deployment phase*. This is the modular
seam that lets new execution backends (Terraform today, others later) plug into
the dashboard without touching the UI: add a ``PhaseDef`` / matcher here and the
statistics, KPI cards and pipeline visualization pick it up automatically.

The orchestrator vision is a three-phase host lifecycle::

    1. PROVISION  (Terraform)  — bring the bare host into existence
    2. CONFIGURE  (Ansible)    — bring the host up to spec / connectivity
    3. DEPLOY     (Services)   — roll out the application services

``connectivity`` and ``rollout`` are existing Ansible-era types; ``single_service``
is a per-service deploy. Terraform types are defined ahead of implementation so
the UI is already able to display them.
